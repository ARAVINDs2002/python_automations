## Features

- Clean and modern UI with a beautiful background.
- Upload Excel file for certificate generation.
- Fully responsive design.
- Easy to use.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)
- ReportLab (`pip install reportlab`)

## Installation

#### Just copy and paste the folder after downloading the whole project as a zip file. If it's a pull request, do as needed (just download the complete project; that's easy).

## How to Run?

#### Installing the requirements is a must. Download it first, then you can just run the `app.py` file and get on to the local host production server. Yes, it's a Python Flask app since the command line version will look a little grumpy; I thought of changing it to Flask as a backend. Also, make sure that the Excel sheet consists of 2 columns: the Name and Rank. Please use this accordingly and make changes as needed. If you want to use another template, feel free to use Canva.

### Thank you, have a nice day!!
